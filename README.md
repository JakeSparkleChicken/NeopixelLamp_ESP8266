# NeopixelLamp_ESP8266
Wifi enabled lamp that changes color based on input from website

Big shout out to [StackExchange](https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/23174/how-to-get-neopixel-to-fade-colorwipe) for the colorFade function, and showing me that my means of separating out the individual color channels was really, really bad.  I left it in since it's mine and it works despite it's inherent ugliness.
